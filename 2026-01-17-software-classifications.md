# Software Classifications & Humanware 

**Date:** 17-Jan-2026

Today I learned how software is categorized based on rights, distribution, and cost. It is not just about "paid vs. free"—it is about freedom vs. restriction.

## 1. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) 
**Definition:** Software that gives the user the freedom to use, copy, distribute, examine, change, and improve it.
* **Examples:** GNU/Linux, GIMP, Mozilla Firefox, OpenOffice.

### The 4 Freedoms of Free Software
For software to be truly "Free" (as in freedom, not just price), it must satisfy these four rules:
1.  **Freedom 0:** The freedom to **run** the program for any purpose.
2.  **Freedom 1:** The freedom to **study** how it works and change it (requires access to source code).
3.  **Freedom 2:** The freedom to **distribute** copies to help others.
4.  **Freedom 3:** The freedom to **improve** the program and release improvements to the public.

## 2. Freeware vs. Shareware 

| Feature | Freeware | Shareware |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Completely free for an unlimited time. | Free for a *trial period* before buying. |
| **Features** | All features are usually free. | Some features may be blocked/limited. |
| **Rights** | Copyrighted; you can use it, but cannot sell or modify it. | Copyrighted; encourages trying before buying. |
| **Examples** | Chrome, Skype. | WinRAR, Antivirus software. |

## 3. Proprietary Software 
**Definition:** Software that is the exclusive property of its developer.
* You cannot copy, change, or distribute it without permission.
* You usually pay for a "license" to use it, not ownership of the code itself.
* **Examples:** Microsoft Windows, MS Office.

## 4. Humanware (Liveware) 
**Definition:** The humans who interact with the computer system.
* Hardware and Software are useless without a user to give commands.
* **Examples:** Computer Programmers, System Administrators, Computer Operators.

**Key Takeaway:** "Free" in FOSS refers to *liberty* (freedom to change code), while "Free" in Freeware refers to *price* (zero cost).
