# 📝 TIL (Today I Learned)
> "Daily consistency beats intensity."

Welcome to my **Today I Learned** repository! This is an open-source collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day-to-day as my journey as a **Self-Taught Developer**.

## 🚀 What is TIL?
TIL is a repository where I document short notes, tips, and tricks that I learn daily. Instead of waiting to write full blog posts, I commit these small learnings here to:
1.  **Track my progress** over time.
2.  **Reinforce my memory** (writing helps remembering!).
3.  **Share knowledge** with the open-source community.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a BCA student and Tech Enthusiast from **Kerala, India**. My passion lies in understanding how computers work "under the hood" and learn programming.

## 📂 Repository Structure
I keep a flat directory structure for simplicity. Files are named using the `YYYY-MM-DD-Topic.md` format to keep them chronologically sorted.

### Topics Covered:
* 🐧 **Linux:** Commands, File System, Permissions
* 💻 **C Language:** Pointers, Memory Management, Algorithms
* 🧠 **Computer Fundamentals:** Hardware, Binary, stc
* 🌐 **Web Development:** Frontend
