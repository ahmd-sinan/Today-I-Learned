# Paradigms: POP vs OOP 

**Date:** 17-Jan-2026

Today I learned about the two main styles of programming: **Procedure Oriented** (like C) and **Object Oriented** (like C++ and Java).
Technically, **C is not an Object-Oriented language**. It does not have keywords like `class`, `inheritance`, or `private`.

*However*, we can *simulate* OOP in C using `structs` and function pointers, but it is manual and difficult. This is why **C++** was invented—to add OOP features directly to C!

## 1. Procedure Oriented Programming (POP) 
**Definition:** A programming style that focuses on functions (procedures) and the sequence of actions to be performed. The main focus is on "doing things."

### 4 Limitations of POP
1.  **No Data Security:** Data moves freely between functions (Global Data), making it vulnerable to accidental changes.
2.  **Hard to Manage:** As programs grow larger, the web of functions becomes difficult to track (Spaghetti Code).
3.  **No Real-World Mapping:** It is hard to model real-world problems (like a "Car" or "Bank Account") using just functions.
4.  **Low Reusability:** Extending the code usually involves modifying existing functions, which can break the program.

## 2. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
**Definition:** A style that organizes software around **Objects** (data) rather than logic. It bundles data and the functions that operate on it together.

### 6 Advantages of OOP
1.  **Data Hiding:** Sensitive data can be made `private`, so only the object itself can change it (Security).
2.  **Reusability:** We can use **Inheritance** to use existing code without rewriting it.
3.  **Real-World Modeling:** We can design software that looks like the real world (e.g., a `Student` object with `Name` and `Marks`).
4.  **Maintainability:** It is easier to fix bugs because code is modular (isolated in classes).
5.  **Flexibility (Polymorphism):** The same function name can behave differently depending on the data.
6.  **Scalability:** Much better for building large, complex systems.

## 3. Basic OOP Concepts 

| Concept | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Class** | A blueprint or template that defines the variables and methods common to all objects of a certain kind (e.g., the blueprint of a Car). |
| **Object** | A specific instance of a class; a runtime entity that has state and behavior (e.g., *this* specific red BMW). |
| **Data Abstraction** | The process of hiding complex background details and showing only the essential features to the user (like a car dashboard). |
| **Encapsulation** | Wrapping up data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (Class) to protect the data. |
| **Inheritance** | The mechanism where a new class derives properties and behavior from an existing class (e.g., "Truck" inherits from "Vehicle"). |
| **Polymorphism** | The ability of a message or function to be displayed in more than one form (e.g., `+` can add numbers or join strings). |

## 4. Comparison: POP vs OOP 

| Feature | POP (C) | OOP (C++/Java) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Focuses on **Functions/Algorithms**. | Focuses on **Data/Objects**. |
| **Division** | Program is divided into functions. | Program is divided into objects. |
| **Access Control** | No access modifiers (mostly public). | Has `public`, `private`, `protected`. |
| **Data Movement** | Data moves freely (Global). | Data is protected and restricted. |
| **Approach** | Bottom-Up or Top-Down. | Mainly Bottom-Up. |
